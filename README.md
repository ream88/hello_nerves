# HelloNerves

My first [Built with Nerves](http://nerves-project.org) project
running on [Andre's](https://github.com/mcandy007) Raspberry Pi
he has given me a long time ago.

My goals for this project are:

- [x] Build and run an OTP application on the Raspberry Pi.
- [x] Start communication via Morse code. (I'm currently lacking any HDMI-enabled display).
- [ ] Provide some form of communication via LAN. Maybe `iex` over LAN?
